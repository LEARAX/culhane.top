# About

Welcome to my website!

My name is Will. I am a student at Montana State University studying
chemical and computer engineering. I love all things involving UN\*X,
hardware design, or chemistry. In my free time I enjoy biking,
running, and programming.

My time is split between Bozeman, Billings, and Austin. I went to high
school in Boise, and was born in Atlanta.

Recently I've mostly been preoccupied with my classes, which include a
lot of LaTeX, occasional Python scripts, and a fair bit of VHDL. Most
of my projects are on [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~learax/),
although not a lot of it is public at the moment; I also maintain
mirrors on [GitHub](https://github.com/LEARAX).
