# About

Welcome to my website!

My name is Will. I am a student at Montana State University studying
chemical engineering. I love all things involving UN\*X, computer
hardware, or chemistry. In my free time I enjoy biking, running, and
programming.

My time is split between Bozeman, Billings, and Austin. I went to high
school in Boise, and was born in Atlanta.

Recently I've mostly been preoccupied with my classes, which include a
lot of LaTeX, some VHDL, and a crazy number of flowcharts. Most of my
projects are on [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~learax/), although not
a lot of them are public at the moment; I also maintain mirrors on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LEARAX).
