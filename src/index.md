# About Will

Welcome to my website! My name is Will, and I am a student at Montana
State University studying chemical engineering. I love all things involving
UN\*X, Emacs, or chemistry.

Most of my projects are on [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~learax/); I also
maintain mirrors on [GitHub](https://github.com/LEARAX).
