# About

## General

Welcome to my website!

My name is Will. I am a student at [Montana State
University](https://www.montana.edu/) studying chemical engineering. I
love all things involving UN\*X, chemistry, and hardware design. In my
free time I enjoy biking, running, and programming.

## Locations

I have lived in/spent an extended period of time in the following
places:

- [Atlanta, GA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta)
- [Austin, TX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas)
- [Billings, MT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billings,_Montana)
- [Boise, ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho)
- [Bozeman, MT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozeman,_Montana)

## Current activities/projects

Recently I've mostly been preoccupied with my classes, which include a
lot of LaTeX, some VHDL, and a lot of C. Most of my projects are on
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~learax/), although not a lot of them
are public at the moment; I also maintain mirrors on
[GitHub](https://github.com/LEARAX).
