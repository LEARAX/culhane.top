# Software

- Most of my computers run Arch Linux with sway/i3. It was the first
  OS I installed myself, and I've tried many different Linux
  distributions (and operating systems) since then, but none have been
  as frictionless as Arch Linux for me.
- For text editing I use GNU Emacs, falling back to Neovim or regular
  vim for quick edits. I make heavy use of org mode. I also really
  like the Emacs calculator.
- I keep my music in a directory that I play using MPD in tandem with
  Cantata, and I also use Cantata to transcode my collection to MP3
  for my phone, so that I can maintain a collection of mostly lossless
  audio on my computer and preserve disk space on my phone.
- I use git for nearly everything. My (encrypted) passwords, my notes,
  every assignment, project, and most of my files are checked into a
  git repository somewhere.
- I prefer to use fish as my shell, but I'm not very happy with any of
  the shells I've used.
- I write my papers/assignments primarily using pdfLaTeX with latexmk.
