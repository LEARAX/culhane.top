# Software

- Most of my computers run Arch Linux with sway/i3. It was the first
  OS I installed myself, and I've tried many different Linux
  distributions (and operating systems) since then, but none have been
  as frictionless as Arch Linux for me.
- For text editing I've slowly been learning GNU Emacs, and it's what
  I'm using currently, but I fall back to Neovim or regular vim for
  quick edits. I make heavy use of org mode.
- I keep my music in a directory that I play using MPD in tandem with
  Cantata, and I also use Cantata to transcode my collection to MP3
  for my phone, so that I can maintain a collection of mostly lossless
  audio on my computer and preserve disk space on my phone.
- I (ab)use git for nearly everything.
- I prefer to use fish as my shell, but I'm not very happy with any of
  the shells I've used.
- I write my papers/assignments primarily using pdfLaTeX with latexmk.
- For writing VHDL I use GHDL & GTKWave for quick debugging, and
  Quartus for more involved stuff.
