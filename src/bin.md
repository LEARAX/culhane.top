# Software

- For text editing I use GNU Emacs, falling back to Neovim or regular
  vim for quick edits. I make heavy use of org mode. I also really
  like the [Emacs calculator][calc_man].
- I write my papers/assignments primarily using pdfLaTeX with latexmk,
  with Makefiles to handle generation of any graphs or code output.
- Most of my computers run Arch Linux with sway/i3. I've tried many
  different Linux distributions (and other operating systems) since
  installing it, but none have been as frictionless as Arch for me.
- I use git for nearly everything. My notes, my tasks, every
  assignment, project, and most of my files are checked into a git
  repository somewhere.
- I prefer to use [fish][fish] as my shell, but I'm not very happy
  with any of the shells I've used.
